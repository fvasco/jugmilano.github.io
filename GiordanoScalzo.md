Giordano Scalzo is a Software jack of all trades, master of none living in Milan (Italy). He does Software for fun since early 80s and hes paid for it since 1997. Got interested in Agile stuff in 2000 and, since then, he tries to follow the principles in everything he do. In the last years moved toward the management part of the develompment, still embrancing all Agile values and spreading them between all people he works with.
