!!What is a wiki?!!
A wiki is a type of website (like Wikipedia) that lets anyone create and edit its pages. In a wiki, people can write pages together. If one person writes something which is incorrect, then the next person can correct it. The next person can also add something new to the page. Because of this, the page gets better whenever someone changes it.

!!How to edit a topic!!
Just go to the topic and click on the "Edit Page" link in the bar at the top or bottom of the topic.

To delete a topic, put only the word "delete" by itself in the topic and save it. It will be removed completely when your administrator runs a purge.
