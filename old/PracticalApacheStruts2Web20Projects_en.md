Now that Struts2, the merger of Struts (as a community) and [<html>]WebWork[</html>] (as source code), has finally become a solid reality, some books have been finally published to fill the empty shelf for this argument.

The author of this book has already published [http://www.infoq.com/minibooks/starting-struts2|a free e-book on InfoQ], with the possibility to order a paid printed copy. If that book could disappoint for its instant book style, this one could suffer from the same destiny if you expect an omnicomprensive guide on the argument, maybe starting as a beginner  in the development of web applications in java.

Nevertheless '''Practical Apache Struts2 Web 2.0 Projects''' is still a very good book, but personally I've been able to appreciate it only after being involved in the deveopment of a full-blown project with Struts2 instead of limiting myself to the base examples. In this context it's beena precious guide to get all the new features introduced past [<html>]WebWork[</html>], especially the new annotations' stuff and the ease of development with the introduction of Rails-style ''convention over configuration''. Here it is certainly visible all the experience of an author of a book who is also a committer in the Struts2 project and can give directions on essential subtleties and put everything in its place between all the possible ways to reach an objective, which in the Struts2 framework are too often more than one, wether or not for legacy reasons.

Another argument which in my opinion has been described really well is the context in which the framework is proposed, that is the one of the '''Web 2.0 applications'''. The target of proposing Struts2 as a competitive choice in this field has been surely hit. The overview on the business themes around Web 2.0, its enabling technologies, and the opening towards the user are described in such a clear way to make this book intereseting just to learn more about Web 2.0, even ignoring Struts2.

Besides the pragmatic approach on side arguments, which are anyway essential for the final result, like the setup of the development environment or the software production process management using agile methods, or the emphasis on testing and continuous integration systems, makes finally see these aspects as concrete and estabilished working tools instead of cheap philosophy arguments, as I too often see them treated. Banally, I've personally found more useful the page on '''Maven''' in this book, from the point of view of a user who's suffered like me in the adoption of this tool and just wants to get things done, than all the official documentation and the online books on the argument.

About the framework '''Struts2''' in itself, ''all the arguments you expect to see are covered'': the integration with ''Spring'' and ''Hibernate/JPA'', input conversion and validation, all the configuration from the base ecamples to all the tricks and most obscure parameters, ''support for AJAX and content syndication'', templating with JSP, FreeMarker and Velocity and output customization, security with ''Acegi'', page layout with ''SiteMesh'', up to the new plugin archtecture for the packaging of the extensions to the framework. It's possible to see each of these arguments in action in the web 2.0 application example for the management of contests which is developed chapter by chapter.

Unfortunately from two thirds of the book on, when you're into the development of the proposed application, ''a few misstepss'' start to appear which heavily lowert the overall quality of the book. First of all lots of repetition of already covered arguments, with similar words and layout, as if the book didn't receive enough reviewing before going to print. Finally what is completely missing is a conclusion to sum up what's been covered and give hints to the reader on how to bring forward his learning path on Struts2. In fact the book ends abruptly after the chapter about integrating Struts2 with a ''GWT frontend'' using its plugin, which is indeed a quite interesting chapter, but leaves the sensation of having in your hands a ''valid but still incomplete'' work, which could really benefit from a revised second edition.

There's also a useful new initiative from Apress, which is active also for this book. Besides the usual source code to download, with the printed book there's also a code to download its e-book version in PDF.
